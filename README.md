# Buy Aged Facebook Accounts for Ads: What No One Tells You

Been running Facebook ads for years, but recently, my accounts kept getting flagged or banned. Tried buying accounts from a few sellers, but most were either low-quality or didn’t last long. Finally found one that worked - my ads are running smoothly, and I’ve seen a 30% increase in ROI since switching to these aged accounts.

  
Here’s the seller I used - their accounts actually work for ads.

Been using these accounts for a month now. They’re aged, verified, and don’t get flagged easily. My campaigns are running without interruptions, and I’m finally scaling my ads without worrying about bans. Might grab a few more just to have backups.
